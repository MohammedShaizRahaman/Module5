SkynetRobotics is developing robots so that humans have a betterinteraction with surrounding environment and their software development was completely in traditionalVCS. Slowly they started using git and seeing its organic growth within many internal teams,they finally decidedto support it officially. They were looking for rapid development, fail fast scenarios and Git helped themachieve it with its fast merging, branching features and git flow techniques. They brought in morefeatures and quickly converted their prototypes into production models and go-to market strategy wasaccelerated, thus it worked out better for them.
